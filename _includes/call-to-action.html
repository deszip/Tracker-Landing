                <p class="text-faded">I created this app out of pure frustration with complicated time tracking solutions. Most productivity apps are overcomplicated, packed with unnecessary features like Jira integration that nobody really needs. What I wanted was something simple â€“ a digital replacement for my trusty pen and notebook.
                    I've been using this tracker myself for five months now, and I'm excited to share it with you. It's the straightforward, no-nonsense time tracking tool I always wished existed.</p>

### About
Tracking time you spend is the most cheap and valuable productivity tool ever existed.
Tracker is an app I've built for myself. Being fed up with "corporate" and fancy trackers offering me Jira integration.

I wanted something to substitute a pen and a notebook. Im using it for a 5 month already and now want to share with you.

### Install
Tracker is in early beta. This means it will change a lot before the relase, mostly because of your feedback.
App is available via this link: [get Tracker via TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/BPzFYaHz).

### Features
It's pretty simple, you select category and run timer. Then you can see different stats.
It has widgets so ypu can check some stats without opening the app.
It also has a push notifications for forgotten timers and live activity to check what timer is running now.

This list will grow. Feel free to post your feature requests in this repo.
